# Bergen-Community-College-3SP-Ethical-Hacking-and-Virus-Creation-Project-Homework

These were my very first steps in coding as part of the STEM Student Scholars Program (3SP) at Bergen Community College. At the time of creating this repository, I am still participating in the Ethical Hacking and Virus Creation using C++ project during Summer 2020. 

This homework assignment, assigned over two weeks, creates a program that performs the following tasks:

1.) Creates a file with the following text: My name, the course number, and the grade.

2.) Makes a copy of that file with a different file name.

3.) Goes back to the first created file and changes the grade from A to F.

4.) Adds a message at the end of the first file. My professor had given the example "Your grade has been changed by me."

5.) Removes the second file, which is the good copy of the first file, and moves it to another folder. Makes the new folder "look dangerous" and puts it in the C:\ directory.

6.) Makes 200 copies of the good copy file in the same directory. Appends 2.txt, 3.txt, etc. to the file names. (That was what was assigned; however, I was able to get it to work by creating a new file and making 200 copies of it.)

7.) Outputs (using 'cout'), something akin to "You're hacked. I dumped file 1. You're hacked. I dumped file 2." Have 200 outputs.

8.) Adds a cleanup section to the program. Gives the user a choice to pay up. If the user says "No", the files are left. If the user says "Yes", the files are cleaned up.

9.) Opens the default web browser and opens a website.

10.) Plays a video file.

Do not send Bitcoin to the address in the program. It was generated using bitaddress.org.
